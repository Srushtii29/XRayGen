Bone Fracture Detection and Report Generation
This project is a Django-based web application that allows users to upload X-ray images of broken bones and automatically generates a medical report based on the detected fracture type. The application utilizes machine learning models, including a deep learning model (my_model.h5) for classifying fractures as oblique, transverse, or comminuted, and provides a detailed report with relevant information for healthcare professionals.
Features

Upload X-ray images of broken bones
Automatic fracture classification using machine learning models, including a deep learning model (my_model.h5) for classifying fracture types
Generation of a comprehensive medical report in PDF format
Inclusion of patient information and consulting doctor details

Usage

Run the Django development server.
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL.

This image depicts a sign-up form for a website or application. The form is presented in a sleek and modern design with a dark background and contrasting blue and orange circular elements.
At the top of the form, there is a heading that says "Signup Here." Below the heading, there are several input fields where users can enter their information to create a new account:

Username: A text field where users can enter their desired username. In the example shown, the placeholder text "test@123" is displayed.
Email: A text field where users can enter their email address or phone number. No value is currently filled in this field.
Password: A password field where users can enter their desired password. The field is masked, showing only dots for the characters entered.
Confirm Password: Another password field where users need to re-enter their password to confirm it matches the initial password entry.

After filling out all the required information, users can click the "Signup" button to submit the form and create their account.
Additionally, there is a line of text at the bottom that says "I already have an account," which likely serves as a link or button to navigate to the login page for existing users.
The design incorporates circular shapes with contrasting colors (blue and orange) to create a visually appealing and modern look for the sign-up form.
Overall, this image represents a typical sign-up or registration page commonly found on websites or applications, where new users can enter their credentials to create an account and gain access to the platform's features and services.
